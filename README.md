The ConnectDesk project consists on a table of data that centralizes user information in a company. The project uses role-based authorization, where admin users can create and edit data while normal users can just filter and order it.

## Features

- **Authentication**: log in or sign up to a SQLite database.
- **Centralized user data**: get access to the phone number of an user, their email, and place where they work!
- **Built with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)**: using Typescrpit and modern OOP techniques.

Thanks for visiting this project!

This was originally made in [Express](https://expressjs.com) with plain JavaScript, but over time I thought I needed to migrate it to Nest to get familiar with the framework and learn about OOP.
