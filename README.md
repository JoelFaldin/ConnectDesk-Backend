## ü§ñ Configuration

The project is configured to accept request from `http://localhost:4200/`, the local address of the Angular frontend app. You can change this on the `CorsConfig.java` file, in the main package.
Additionally, the project also has a _logger_ configured to save all data related to database operations. It is applied to every route of the backend but these:
```
/api/users
/api/users/summary
/api/logs/summary
/api/logs/all
/api/logs/{code}
/api/excel/summary
/api/health
```
